# Gnotepad
 Extremely small notepad

The only requirement is ncurses for now.
To make on Ubuntu/Debian systems, you'll want to run this:
`sudo apt-get install build-essential`
And then this to get the ncurses libraries:
`sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

You can make the program with `make`.
